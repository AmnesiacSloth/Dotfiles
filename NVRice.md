# Basic notetaking doc for my own NVRice creation

## TMUX 
- add bunch of keybinds and changes to .tmux.conf
- Tmux Resurrect
- Tmux continuum
- Tmux-which-key (may need to rebind its popup prefix key)
## Nvim w/ Kickstart
#### Custom added plugins / prepackaged that I configured
- gruvbox-baby (bad coloring with neotree add new file?)
- Lualine.nvim
  - Added small config
- todo-comments (added signs = true)
- peek.nvim 
  - needs deno as a dependency
  - if using WSL2, no gui so not possible to use webview
    - use browser instead with a path to executable
